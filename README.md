# Calorie-Tracker

This project is using vanilla JavaScript Module pattern and Materialize CSS and also using the localstorage to persist the data after roload or closing of browser. 

We are going to have a few different module controller, a storage controller for localstorage, an item controller to deal with the data input, an UI controller to manipulate the UI and a main app controller which will work as the intitializer.
