# Calorie-Tracker

This project is using vanilla JavaScript Module pattern and Materialize CSS and also using the LocalStorage to persist the data after roload or closing of browser.

I am going to create a few different module controller, a storage controller for LocalStorage, an item controller to deal with the data input, an UI controller to manipulate the UI and a main app controller which will work as the intitializer.

I have to use event delegation for DOM manipulate to change the UI after the application is loaded.
